# Overview

In this project I was seeking to learn more about C# coding and the connections that can be made specifically to coding GUI's.
I intend on using this knowledge to help me to learn more Syntax for C# and be able to impelment my knowledge in helping create 
scripted projects in Unity in the future. This code is written in C# using a Windows Forms free template included in Windows 
.NET Frameworks.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}

This software I created when run creates a User interface box that pops up. This GUI Allows the user to get the area or perimeter 
of a two dimensional shape they choose. The User is also able to get a visual representation of the shape chosen and input lengths in the specific 
shape to be used in calculation. The C# coding enables and disables inputs from users. I.E: If the square is chosen it will only 
enable one input box, two for a rectangle, and for a circle it enables a circle radius input box. After the User inputs values and 
selected whether they want area or perimeter, the user can click the calculate button and a widow will pop up displaying the 
calutulated Values.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The Purpose of writing this Software was to learn more about correct definitions and syntax for items in C#. This software was 
also created as the first of five Coding projects to add to my proffesional coding portfolio demonstrating my coding abilities. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the 
code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

Here is a visual demo of my finished program.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software includes:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Microsoft .Net Base Frameworks
- Microsoft Forms template provided in .Net Framework

# Useful Websites

- [Windows Forms .Net Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-6.0)
- [C# Windows Forms Application Tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/c-sharp-windows-forms-application.html)

# Future Work

- I could look into adding a Triangle and other 2-Dimensional shapes in the future.
- I could look into adding functionality for 3-Dimensional shapes in the future.
- Something I could improve on would be more personalizing the calculated output text box.
